# Matchstick-Man-Fly-with-Rope
There are two modes in this game, one is Endless mode and the other is Arcade mode. In the Endless mode, players need to tap the building so the protagonist can fly straight forward with a rope, and there is no level in this mode. But in the Arcade mode players need to obtain the required number of stars to enter the next level.
